Input filename: seqs/E38_2014_S27_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: single-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.10
Cutadapt version: 2.6
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count Illumina: 0, count Nextera: 0, count smallRNA: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
Adapter sequence: 'AGATCGGAAGAGC' (Illumina TruSeq, Sanger iPCR; default (inconclusive auto-detection))
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 7 bp
Minimum required sequence length before a sequence gets removed: 15 bp
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 40 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
Output file will be GZIP compressed
